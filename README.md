EduPlanner DSA is an intelligent instructional planning and student monitoring system designed for complex subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms. It serves as a pedagogical co-pilot for educators, leveraging a team of specialized AI agents to enhance, not replace, the teaching experience. Our core philosophy is **"Teacher in the Loop,"** ensuring the professor's expertise remains the central authority in the classroom.

## 1. Project Vision: For the Modern Educator

Teaching advanced subjects requires a deep understanding of individual student needs. In a large classroom, it's nearly impossible to track every student's conceptual gaps in real-time. EduPlanner DSA addresses this by providing educators with a powerful suite of tools to enable personalized, data-driven instruction at scale.

The platform uses a specialized triad of AI agents to augment the professor's capabilities:
*   **The Analyst:** A data specialist that identifies student learning patterns, common errors, and disengagement trends, providing actionable insights for early intervention.
*   **The Evaluator:** An objective instructional coach that analyzes teaching materials against established pedagogical frameworks (like CIDPP: Clarity, Interactivity, Difficulty, Practicality, Completeness) to promote reflective practice and quality improvement.
*   **The Optimizer:** An expert content drafter that generates and refines lesson plans, examples, and assessments based on the professor's goals and the Evaluator's feedback, dramatically increasing efficiency.

This system transforms the traditional instructional cycle into a dynamic, responsive loop where professors are empowered to design, assess, and revise their teaching strategies with unprecedented speed and insight.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Pedagogical Command Center:** A central dashboard providing a real-time overview of course health, student progress via a heatmap, and critical, AI-flagged alerts.
